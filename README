Introduction
------------

Frotate is a file rotation utility, similar to rotatelogs and cronolog.
It takes data on it standard input and writes it to rotation files.

I wrote it because rotatelogs and cronolog were not able to limit the size
of the data written to disk, whereas embeded systems need to strictly
control disk usage.

Example:
cat /dev/zero | frotate --prefix frotate.log --size 524288 -n 3

This writes to the files:
frotate.log
frotate.log.1
frotate.log.2

The size of each of these files is limited by the --size argument (in bytes) (+ the granularity - see below).
The number of these files is limited by the -n argument.


Installation
------------

Set CC to your favorite C compiler and enter 'make'.

Example:
shell> CC=gcc make

Launch the test (optional):
shell> make -C test

And copy the executable 'frotate' to where you need it.


Going Further
-------------
Currently the granularity of the file size is 4096 bytes.
